Identification and Evaluation of Effective Chanel Coding techniques for Channel Propagation Abnormalities to Overcome Channel Propagation Abnormalities

## About
- This mainly constitutes of working towards researching which channel coding technique is good for an additive white noise based channel to avoid channel propagation abnormalities
- The hardware used for running the code was FPGA
- A RX and TX was coded to check for efficiency in Hamming codes and convolutional codes
